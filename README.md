Projects

1. US Ariline Delays - Multiple Linear Regression 

- In this project, I analyzed U.S. airline arrival delays for June using a dataset of 9,354 records to determine key contributors and suggest actionable solutions. A regression analysis explained 99.8% of the variance in arrival delays, identifying significant factors such as Late Aircraft Delay (0.706), Carrier Delay (0.671), NAS Delay (0.583), and Weather Delay (0.293), all with p-values <0.001. Managerial recommendations included improving scheduling, expanding runways, increasing airport gate capacity, and enhancing employee training and aircraft maintenance to minimize delays and improve on-time performance. The analysis provides a clear understanding of delay causes and practical strategies for mitigation.

2. Bank Deposit Term Suscription Prediction - Data mining

- In this project, I conducted a data mining analysis for a bank's direct marketing campaign using the CRISP-DM methodology to predict whether clients would subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset included 17 variables and 4,521 observations with no missing values. Data preparation involved cleaning, importing into SAS Enterprise Miner, and exploring variables such as age, balance, and contact duration. I applied decision tree, regression, and neural network models to predict client behavior. The decision tree indicated that call duration and previous campaign outcomes were significant factors. A stepwise logistic regression highlighted the importance of variables like call duration, marital status, and whether the client had a loan. The neural network model also performed well, but the regression model showed the best validation misclassification rate (0.09779). This analysis identified key factors influencing client decisions, offering insights for future campaigns to improve customer engagement.

3. Marketing Strategies Evaluation - Customer Segmentation

- In April 2024, I collaborated on a customer segmentation project that aimed to analyze customer demographics and behaviors to identify distinct market segments. Using Python for data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, we uncovered four unique customer segments. Our analysis provided insights into customer demographics, spending behavior, and preferences, which informed marketing strategies and product development. The findings emphasized the importance of targeted marketing campaigns, customer retention programs, and service customization, especially for high-value segments such as healthcare professionals and lawyers.

4. Home Ownership Prediction

- I developed a Homebuyer Prediction model using logistic regression in R. The project utilized data from the 2018 American Community Survey, narrowing down over 2.5 million observations to predict the likelihood of homeownership based on demographic and economic variables. Key findings showed that factors such as income, marital status, and proximity to metro areas significantly influenced homeownership. The model achieved 81% accuracy, and the insights were used to recommend targeted marketing campaigns for real estate companies and government assistance programs for low-income individuals.

5. KUS Sales Prediction - Multiple Linear Regression

- I conducted a sales prediction analysis for KUS using Multiple Linear Regression in SAS. The analysis spanned data from 2019 to 2023, focusing on eight variables influencing sales. The model achieved an adjusted R-squared of 0.81, indicating that 81% of the variation in sales could be explained by the independent variables. Key predictors included seasonal factors, retail sales of used cars, total vehicle sales, and interest rates. The insights derived from this analysis aim to assist KaGA and KUS in accurately estimating sales and production while also providing recommendations for future monitoring and model enhancement.
